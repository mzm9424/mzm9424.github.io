# Bit Trade Net Demo Web App

A responsive front‑end simulation of a trading platform workflow.  
This project demonstrates a **login → dashboard → withdrawal notice** flow using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.  
It is **educational/demo only** — no backend, no real transactions, no sensitive data handling.
